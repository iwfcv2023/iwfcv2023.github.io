## Presentation Instructions
### Oral Presentation Instructions
Each oral presentation is allocated 15 minutes: 10 minutes for presentation + 5 minutes for Q&A and setup. And each extended-summary presentation is allocated 5 minutes for presentation + 2 minutes for Q&A and setup.

At the workshop, 10 minutes before your session, you must:

Introduce yourself to your session chair in the presentation room
Test your laptop or upload your slides to the conference computer
If you use the conference computer, remember to embed (and not link) all videos into the presentation file

The LCD projector has both VGA and HDMI connections. While the projector is compatible with wide-size (16:9 or 16:10) presentation slides, the size (aspect ratio) of the screen is standard-size (4:3). So, be sure that a wide-size presentation will be reduced in size to fit the screen width.

The speed of the internet connection will be limited. We do not recommend you to use video-streaming or online-demonstration in your presentation.

## Poster Presentation Instructions
The poster panels can accommodate posters of A0 portrait size. Please use sufficiently large fonts for readability. We do not specify any poster templates and can not provide poster-printing services.

The location of your poster will be identified by the paper number from the program. Materials to attach your poster to the board (before 9 am of your day of presentation) will be provided. Each poster is to be presented for a full day.

## Post-Workshop Proceedings

<!--The organizing committee will publish the post-workshop proceedings of IW-FCV2022 as a Springer Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series after the workshop. The post-workshop proceedings will include only high-quality papers selected by reviewers.

The condition under which a paper is subject to peer review for inclusion in the post-workshop proceedings are as follows:

The paper must be a full paper (12-15 pages) that contains original research that has neither been published nor submitted for publication elsewhere.

When submitting a paper, the authors should indicate their intention to include the paper in the post-workshop proceedings.
In addition, in order for a paper to be included in the post-workshop proceedings, it must:

be presented at the workshop by at least one author.

When submitting a camera-ready version, the authors should complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form to transfer the copyright for the paper to the publisher.

The post-workshop proceedings will be included in Springer Link Digital Library. And workshop attendees will have free access for four weeks after the post-workshop proceedings are published.

Authors should consult [Springer's authors' guidelines] and use their proceedings templates for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. Please kindly refer to [the editorial policies webpage] and note the importance of this.-->
